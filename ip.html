                    <p class="content-text">We believe that your inventions, discoveries, and brands are valuable
                        assets. They have to be protected strategically so that you get a legal monopoly over your
                        competitors. We develop an IP strategy to protect your IPRs so that your IP assets are safe and
                        you avoid infringement issues and litigation costs.</p>
                    <p class="content-text mt-3">a. <b>IP Management & Audit</b></p>
                    <p class="content-text">The team at IntellexEmpire works with its clients to manage their IPs such
                        that they can maximize the benefits of the IPs.We support clients to develop a framework to
                        identify and develop IPs. We can participate in discussions with venture capitalists and funding
                        firms on behalf of companies to get the right agreements and appropriate funds for the companies
                        to work on their IPs. <br>
                        Intellectual property is a valuable business asset. It has to be audited. We will help you track
                        the quality and usage of your IP assets. We will set up a procedure to review IPs owned, used or
                        acquired. This will help in discovering the criticality of the IP for business and the financial
                        impact of the IP. Audits can also reveal potential ideas that can be patented.
                    </p>

                    <p class="content-text">A proper IP strategy will help to manage existing IPs and also develop a
                        process to increase the number of IPs in the portfolio. Our proficient team will provide
                        analysis on the status of current IPs such as trademarks, copyrights, and patents. We can work
                        on negotiations related to IP transfers and licensing.</p>

                    <p class="content-text">The burden of valuation of your IPs, protection of your IPs and avoiding
                        infringement of your patents, trademarks and other IP property is on you. In high-pressure
                        mergers and acquisitions or setting up collaborations and partnerships and investment
                        transactions, objective IP evaluation is important. IP due diligence is therefore extremely
                        important just like in any other business transaction. <br>
                        Our IPR team can conduct thorough due diligence for your IP assets. We will define and analyze
                        the IP portfolio. We will determine the absolute value of the assetsâ€”patents, copyrights and
                        trademarks based on features, scope, and enforceability of the IP. <br>
                        IP assets are sold and licensed as standalone assets. You can engage our services to
